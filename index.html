<h1><b>History of Classical Athens</b></h1>

<p>Athens was a city-state in Ancient Greece. The name Athens comes from the Greek Goddess Athena. The peninsula of Athens is located in the southern side of Greece and it is surrounded by the Aegean Sea, 
the Gulf of Evoikos, the Saronic Gulf and the Gulf of Corinth. By the sixth century BC, Athens became the dominant economic power in Greece. 
Athens was at the center of an efficient trading system with other Greek city states.
Trade was extremely important for Athens. Athens is surrounded by mountains which made farming very difficult. They relied on fishing to get most of their food. The Athenians established many colonies.</p>

    <h2>Achievements</h2>

<p>Athens was the birthplace of democracy. The act of voting to choose your leaders began in Athens. Many countries countries based off of Athens' democracy. 
An aristocrat named Solon created opportunities for the common people to participate in 
government. Pericles led Athens into its golden age. He encouraged education and brought philosophers, writers, and artists into Athens. Socrates was an influential person who lived in Athens.
He came up with a lot of philosophies that infulenced the world. He came up with the Socratic method. The Socratic method is the act of asking many questions to get answers.
"The sculptor Phidias created his great works for the Parthenon on the Acropolis and the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. Democritus envisioned an atomic universe. Aeschylus, Euripides, Aristophanes, and Sophocles wrote their famous plays. 
This legacy continued as, later, Plato founded his Academy outside the walls of Athens in 385 BCE and, even later, Aristotle's Lyceum was founded in the city center." (Khan 1) Slaves were crucial to Athens' economy.
They cultivated food, served manual labor,
and worked on large projects like the Parthenon. The Parthenon was a temple that was very Holy for the Greek people. Construction began in 447 bc when Greece was at the height of its power. It stands at a massive 45 feet.

<p>"Greek colonization invigorated the networks of trade and exchange throughout the Mediterranean. Greek language and culture spread throughout the region. However, it also brought conflict and tensions with the Persian empire, 
inaugurating the two-decade long Persian Wars from 500 to 479 BCE. As Persia consolidated its control over its conquests in Anatolia, Greek communities living in that area, called Ionia, resisted Persian rule. 
To support the Ionian Greeks, the Athenians sent their impressive fleet, which prompted retribution from the Persians. The ensuing conflict drew in other Greek city-states, most notably, Sparta. 
Conflict between the Greeks and Persians continued for over 100 years." (Khan 1)

"Though the Greek city-states were unified to some extent in the face of an external threat, as that threat waned, conflicts between the city-states made a resurgence. Following the wars,
Athens emerged as the supreme naval power in Greece. It formed the Delian League, ostensibly to create a cohesive Greek network among city-states to ward off further Persian attacks.
Under the leadership of Pericles, Athens grew so powerful that the Athenian Empire could effectively dictate the laws, customs, and trade of all her neighbors in Attica and the islands of the Aegean.
The might of the Athenian Empire encouraged an arrogance in Athenian policy makers of the day which grew intolerable to the other city-states. 
When Athens sent troops to help Sparta put down a Helot rebellion, the Spartans refused the gesture and sent the Athenian force back home in dishonor, thus provoking the war which had long been brewing. 
Later, when Athens sent their fleet to help defend its ally Cocyra—Corfu—against a Corinthian invasion during the Battle of Sybota in 433 BCE, their action was interpreted by Sparta as aggression instead of assistance, 
as Corinth was an ally of Sparta.

The Peloponnesian War—which took place between 431 and 404 BCE between Athens and Sparta, though it involved directly or indirectly all of Greece—ended in disaster for Athens when it was defeated. 
Its empire and wealth decimated, its walls destroyed, only Athen’s reputation as a great seat of learning and culture prevented the sack of the city and the enslavement of the populace." (Khan 1)
